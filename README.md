# Gatsby starter with TypeScript and PWA

## ðŸ¥… Added in this starter

This project is a fork of [official default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), with some added features which I personally prefer.

1. TypeScript support
1. Offline support
1. Added a service worker script
1. eslint, tsc check, etc.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    ```shell
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/markselby9/gatsby-starter-typescript-pwa.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `https://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`https://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
